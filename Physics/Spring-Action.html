        <h2>Spring Force (Hook's Law)</h2>
        <p> In physics, Hooke's law is an empirical law which states that the force, \(F_{s}\) needed to 
          extend a spring by some distance \(d\) scales linearly with respect to that distance,
            $$ \vec{F_{s}} = -k\vec{d}  $$ 
          
         
            where \(k\) is a constant factor characteristic of the spring ((a measure of the spring's stiffness), 
            and \(\vec{d}\) is the displacement of the spring's free end from its position when 
            the spring is in its <b>relaxed state</b> (neither compressed nor
            extended) also \(d\) is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring.

          <h2> SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION</h2>
          <p>
            Any motion that repeats at regular intervals is called periodic motion or harmonic motion. 
            Here we are interested in a periodic motion of simple harmonic motion (SHM) type which can be
            represented using a sinusoidal function of time \(t\). In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the 
            displacement \(x(t)\) of a particle from its equilibrium position is described by the equation
            $$ x = x_{m} \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$
            in which \(x_{m}\) is the amplitude of the displacement, \((\omega t + \phi)\) is
            the phase of the motion, and \(\phi\) is the phase constant. The
            angular frequency \(\omega\) is related to the period and frequency of
            the motion by 
            $$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$$
           
            Differentiating \(x(t)\) leads to equations for the particle's SHM velocity and acceleration 
            as functions of time:
            <p>
              velocity
              $$v = - \omega x_{m} \sin(\omega t + \phi)  $$
            </p>
            <p>
             acceleration
              $$ a = -\omega^{2} x_{m} \cos(\omega t + \phi)  $$
            </p>
            In the velocity function, the positive quantity \(\omega x_{m} \) is the velocity amplitude \(v_{m} \).
            In the acceleration function, the positive quantity \(\omega^{2} x_{m} \) is the acceleration amplitude \(a_{m} \).
            <h2> SHM in a Spring </h2>
            A particle with mass \(m\) that moves under the influence of a
            Hooke's law restoring force given by \(F = -kx\) is a linear simple harmonic 
            oscillator with
            <p>
              Angular frequency,
              $$\omega = \sqrt \frac{k}{m} $$
            </p>
           <p>
             and Time Period,
            $$ T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi\sqrt \frac{m}{k} $$
           </p>
            
           The mechanical energy of a linear oscillating spring is given by the sum of 
           potential energy and kinetic energy.
           
           \[E = U(t) + K (t)\]

           \[U(t) = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2} = \frac{1}{2}kx_{m}^{2} \cos^{2}(\omega t+\phi) \] 
           \[K(t) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x_{m}^{2}\sin^{2}(\omega t +\phi)\]
           where the potential energy and kinetic energy of a linear oscillator are 
           functions of time \(t\)
           <dl>
            <dt>
                &#160 &#xa0 &#10148  Angular frequency \(\omega = \sqrt \frac{k}{m}\) gives 
                spring constant \(k=\omega^{2}m\)
                 
           </dt>
          </dl> 
          
          Thus, the mechanical energy in an oscillating spring is
          \[E = \frac{1}{2} kx_{m}^{2} \]
          <dl>
            <dt>
                &#160 &#xa0 &#10148  The mechanical energy of a linear oscillator is constant and independent of
                time.
